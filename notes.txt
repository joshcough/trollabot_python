To install packages, use:
`python3 -m pip install library-name`

For some reason, other commands don't seem to work properly and result in "module not found" errors.

## Auto-Restart Implementation (2024)

The bot now includes:
- Automatic reconnection on IRC disconnects (2 second delay)
- Automatic restart on crashes (10 second delay)
- Fresh database session on each restart (fixes old transaction error issues)
- Circuit breaker: stops after 10 restarts in 60 seconds to prevent infinite loops
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT signals

Notifications are sent via Discord and/or Email when:
- Bot crashes with full error traceback
- Bot attempts to restart
- Fatal error prevents restart

Configure notifications in .env file - see .env.example for details.
